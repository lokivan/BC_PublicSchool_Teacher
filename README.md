### Usage
To explore the datasets and analyses, it provides: 

* __Informed Workforce Planning__: The analysis provides insights into teacher demographics and trends, enabling effective workforce planning and resource allocation to address staffing needs in particular districts 

* __Promotion of Equity and Diversity__: By examining gender distribution and other demographic factors in each district, the findings can guide initiatives aimed at enhancing equity and representation within the teaching workforce. For instance, the data reveals that the number of female teachers is significantly larger than that of male teachers across all three types of occupations over the past years. This insight could inform policies that encourage more male candidates to consider careers in education, helping to balance gender representation in the workforce.

* __Academic Studies__: Provide a foundation for academic research related to teacher demographics, retention rates, and student outcomes, contributing to the broader field of education studies.
